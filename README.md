🏏 CWC 2023 Data Analysis 

This project presents a data analysis and visualization of the Cricket World Cup (CWC) 2023, using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. It explores performance insights, patterns, and comparisons between teams and players based on actual match data.

📌 Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the CWC 2023 dataset.
Use visualizations to uncover meaningful insights about:
Team performance
Player statistics
Match outcomes
Make the analysis interactive and visually engaging using plotting libraries.
Present the data in a way that is understandable even for non-technical cricket fans.
