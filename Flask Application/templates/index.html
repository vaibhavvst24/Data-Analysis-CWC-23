                        In the 2023 Cricket World Cup, <b>Toss decisions</b> played a crucial role in match outcomes, with teams often choosing to bat first on high-scoring pitches or opting to field under favorable chasing conditions.

This strategy worked well in venues like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, where teams batting first recorded massive scores.
